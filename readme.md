QPED - Feedback tools for Python
========================

## Checkers
Certain parts of this project are referred to as *checkers*. A checker is a module that can be configured individually and has a specific analytical function for the submitted code. A *Syntax Checker* is for instance used to analyze the syntax of submitted code and generate feedback in that specific regard. Below you may find a list of currently implemented checkers and a sort description of each one.

### Syntax Checker
Syntax checker has the ability to analyze Python code and report the encountered errors in friendly form for students with extra information.

You can see the list of syntax errors [here](/flake8-syntax-msgs.properties).

### Style Checker
Style checker is able to find and report common formatting violations that worsen code quality. Style errors are based on [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). The report also contains examples for fixing the violations.

You can see the list of style errors [here](/flake8-style-msgs.properties).

### Semantics Checker
Semantics checker analyzes the meaning of the code. For example, two typical semantic errors are the variable is not defined where it is used and two parameters in a function has the same name.  

You can see the list of syntax errors [here](/flake8-semantic-msgs.properties).

Configuration
------------
The configuration uses JSON-syntax. Each configuration is located in a separate JSON-object. For use with Quarterfall, use a code-action and add the specific JSON-objects to the qf object. In the case of the Python Checker, `mainSettings` object is only required.

Thanks to the `mainSettings` object, we can configure the global aspects of the feedback that is generated by the Python Checker. Possible variables and values are detailed below (default values are in bold).

| Option Name       | Description | Possible Values                           | 
|-------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| `styleNeeded`| Indicates if the feedback must provide style errors | true or **false** |
| `semanticNeeded`| Indicates if the feedback must provide semantic errors | true or **false** |
| `errorsCategorized`| Indicates if the feedback must provide errors separated in categories (i.e. syntax, style and semantic) | **true** or false |

As you can see, there is not an option for syntax errors. Due to the importance of syntax erros, they are always provided.

An example of configuration, in Quarterfall, in which the three types of errors are asked to be provided with the feedback would be:

```json
qf.mainSettings = {
	"styleNeeded":"true",
	"semanticNeeded":"true"
}
```

If it is desired that errors are provided in the order in which they are present in the code, instead of type, then the configuration is as follows:

```json
qf.mainSettings = {
	"styleNeeded":"true",
	"semanticNeeded":"true",
	"errorsCategorized": "false"
}
```


> ### Important
> 
> Remember that the whole configuration in Quarterfall is done by means of an object called ``qf``.
